          The best way to represent time is through the Time Stone itself. It's
          quite a terrible way to keep time, because as this would indicate:
          time was manipulated to bring the apple back to its original state
          before it was eaten. However, I can live knowing that the first thirty
          seconds of a minute, time moves forward in a way that is familiar to
          us. It's only what comes after, for the remainder of the minute, that
          time is manipulated and it feels like we're only going backwards.

          Design Process
        </h2>

        <p>
          The process for this was simple. It all boiled down to coding 6
          different versions of my apples and utilizing "if/else if" statements
          to specify what time intervals will draw what apple. The remainder of
          the assignment was added fun, bringing together the "Time Stone"
          theme.

          90% of this assignment was coding the apples. I used a series of
          curveVertex points to draw a more natural feeling shape. I originally
          intended on making the curves look perfect, but soon realized the
          imperfections an apple has. Therefore, I ditched the "perfectionist"
          look and decided to go for something that had irregular curves to show
          off the natural form of an apple better. I did the "first" layer as
          the red portion of the apple, then added the "yellow" layer as the
          flesh. There are certain points that are a simple copy+paste from the
          red to yellow portions, because this allowed the curves to line up
          perfectly. I repeated this for 6 different apples, each one editing
          the points through trial and error to see which curves best suited the
          images. After the apples were done, it became a matter of writing out
          the "if/else if" statements. I used second() as the standard of time.
          I utilized && and || to state what second intervals I wanted each
          specific apple to appear - there were six total apples, so I used 5
          second intervals to so each apple could appear for ten seconds within
          the minute.

          I ended up choosing the apple sketch because it was the one that would
          challenge me the most. The other sketches felt too abstract; for me, I
          wanted to convey time through something that was somewhat grounded in
          reality. Many of the examples of "time" that were shown to us were
          very abstract.

      </div>
      <p>
        As the other two sketches demonstrate, abstraction through geometric
        shapes or lines was something that I considered. After going over the
        three sketches, I came to the conclusion that it would be a more
        creative exercise to go for the apples. It was an idea that I had from
        the very beginning, and I wanted to run with it. And that I did.

          What am I reflecting on?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Rubber duck. This was the assignment that really taught me the
          importance of rubber-ducking your code. And wow, did it help. Coding
          all the curveVertex points out loud not only helped me understand
          where they needed to go, but I was able to mentally visualize it as
          well. In addition, by speaking the "if/else if" statements out loud, I
          was able to better understand what needed to be written out. It really
          put into perspective of how coding is just another language that I
          have to learn; and that the way we code is very much the way we
          interact in real life. At the end of the day, I designed a hell of a
          clock. Well, sort of. A clock that doesn't conform to the standard
          notion of "time." But it's no matter! I learned the best usage of
          "if/else" statements and learned to also manipulate other areas of
          code to reflect what I want.
