        Well, the exquisite corpse resulted in something H.P. Lovecraft couldn't
        even dream of: an obscurely cute and horrific being so otherworldy that
        it conjures existential dread, while also being extremely cuddly.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The Being
      </h2>
      <p>
        There's no name for this creature; in fact, I cannot describe it, no
        matter how hard I try. Nor do I know what it wants? Does it feel? Does
        it have good or bad intentions? Does it even have any intentions? The
        night I saw The Being, I was out in the sea. The waters were calm and
        the air thin. Out of nowhere, a groaning came from deep within the
        waters, as if the sea let out a cry. Slowly, the water began to tremble
        more and more. Clouds rolled over turning the sky dark indigo. An
        eruption from the water shook the earth with rage. And out comes The
        Being.
      </p>

      <p>
        What can I say about this Being? The terror I felt, first and foremost.
        But, then I felt an urge to embrace the Being with intimate love. It
        wasn't anything I've ever felt. No. It was a new experience. But, it
        felt nostalgic as well. How can I both wish for death, but feel
        passionate toward this thing? Curiosity overtook me, and I steered my
        boat forward to observe, knowing that I would be going forward into a
        direction with no chances of return. Seconds go by, and I stood in front
        of the Being. Butterflies in my stomach. Knees trembling and feeling
        weak. If I felt such fear, why did I also feel joy? A paradox of
        emotions raged within me, just as the sea itself raged with the Being.
        Is this my Hell? Or is this my Heaven? Perhaps it's both, and perhaps
        it's neither. The intense oxymoron of emotions tore me apart. Literally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I speak to you through the conscious of the Being. My soul and mind
        seemingly merging with the Being, as my body and flesh fills the wooden
        floor of my boat. I am the Being. The Being was always me. And what of
        you, who is reading my thoughts? Are you, you?
      </p>

        Design Process
      </h2>

      <p>
        It's interesting doing this through code versus on paper. I've done this
        exercise before; where I partnered up with another person and drew the
        top half, and them the lower half. Fast forward three years, and I'm
        doing this through code. And I treated this assignment the same way; do
        one body part at a time.
      </p>

          I was partnered with Duo and Tong, both of whom shared some lovely and
          detailed sketches. Tonally and thematically, they could not have been
          more opposite of each other. Duo's sketches had a very "kawaii" look
          to it, and Tong's felt very lovecraftian (I immediately thought of
          Cthulu). I took inspiration from Junji Ito when I did my sketches.
          Bringing these three sketches into one exquisite corpse was going to
          result in a beautiful and very odd looking thing. And that was my
          driving factor for the assignment.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were many elements of the sketch that was comprised of the shape
          basic function, such as rect() or ellipse(). Naturally it made sense
          to create a user-defined function with its own set of parameters and
          arguments to better organize the code. Unfortunately, I had to utilize
          a lot of curveVertex() so those I couldn't define under a function.
          However, I still kept an element of modularity and reusability through
          the remainder of the user-defined functions.

          I permit you to look at the secret codes:

        <h2>
          I Look Into a Mirror and What Do I See? My Reflection
        </h2>

        <p>
          This felt like the first assignment; it felt long and tedius having to
          draw the sketches through code, when I could've easily recreated it
          through the classic pen and paper. But it was a fantastic exercise
          because it helped me be more confident in writing functions, vertex
          points, and all the other goodies packaged in this lovely code.
          Everything I've learnt so far has been used in one form or another in
          this assignment, which is pretty cool to see (and even cooler to
          implement). Would I do exquisite corpse again, through code? Probably
          not.
