        This game relies on audio for the full experience. Please play with
        headphones if you can.

        Warning: there are some loud sounds throughout the game.

      <h2>
        My Nightmarish Autobiographical Game
      </h2>

      <p>
        To state the obvious: yes, this game is heavily inspired by P.T. In
        fact, you can argue that it's a 2D top-down rendition of P.T. I remember
        first playing it; the one game that has truly terrified me to no end.
        It's been years since I played it (no thanks to Konami for removing it
        from existence). I look back to the game and think about how it so
        accurately portrayed nightmares, madness, and even mental health. Which
        brings me to the autobiographical part of this game.
      </p>

      <p>
        This game represents the struggle I once had with my own mental health.
        More specifically at times when it felt like my mind was spiraling into
        darkness, no matter how hard I tried to get out. Hence, why I decided to
        make this game feel like P.T., because to me that game represents what
        it's like to be stuck and helpless, all while the world around you
        spiraled and got darker. During some of the darker periods of my
        depression, I would find myself stuck in a "limbo" where I couldn't
        really get out of an episode. I had all the help I could get, but I
        still couldn't escape. In the game, this is represented by the seemingly
        endless hallways and loops that the character goes through. Each time,
        it only seems to get more nightmarish and mad. It's a pretty terrifying
        rendition, but the metaphor is there to represent something that's truly
        terrifying and real.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The Endless Hallway
      </h2>

      <p>
        The idea of the endless hallway (other than being inspired by P.T.) is
        to represent an endless struggle. Trying to get out and escape with no
        luck, only to be driven more mad. This gameplay mechanic is the exact
        thing I knew I wanted to design from the very conception of the idea.
        The greybox of the hallway is, visually, very simple. As seen below,
        it's essentially two rectangles to represent the negative space, outside
        of the hallway, and the character.
      </p>

      <p>
        The, very long, code for my game can be accessed here:
        https://editor.p5js.org/kvnelvn/sketches/y14Eb4_ME
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">

          src="https://cdn.glitch.me/7fdd7b1f-4fc3-4de1-8d00-262541ed753c%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-11-09%20at%2011.59.13%20PM.png?v=1636520366627"

      <p>
        In fact, the gameplay mechanics were extremely difficult to code out.
        Making sure collision detection was coded correctly took weeks to do. On
        top of that, there was a lot of sound that was added; each sound had to
        be triggered by the character's x and y position. In addition, there was
        also triggering the "enemy" of the game, Lisa. It was a matter of
        importing a lot of different assets, giving them their own functions,
        and calling them to appear at exact moments.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">

      </div>

      <p>
        Just like P.T., there's an endless corridor that the player has to
        navigate. I wanted to take that design element and incorporate a version
        of that into my 2D game world. There's two sides of my story in this:
        one lies within the deeper, more personal aspect regarding my mental
        health and how this game can portray that. The other is just how moved I
        was by P.T. when I first played it. I can honestly look back at that
        time and say that it was that game that inspired me to pursue design
        through the horror lens.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The Horror Experience
      </h2>

      <p>
        This game had to be horror. It had to be scary. It had to be an absolute
        maddening nightmare. After all, it did represent a dark side and dark
        time of my life. Audio plays a big role in horror, and as a result, also
        plays a big role in my game. I have to give credit to all the various
        artists I sampled noises, soundtracks, and music from, so that I could
        bring the experience together.
      </p>

      <p>
        On top of the audio and visual, the overall gameplay was designed with
        horror in mind. It's purposefully confusing and frustrating; yes, you
        are supposed to question whether or not you're even making progress in
        the game. So, as you continue down each hallway and "advance" each
        level, I am purposefully making you confused and frustrated and question
        everything. Because that's how it was like, for me, to deal with a
        worsening anxiety and depression.
