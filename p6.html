        I think I check my email too many times during the day. Not only do I
        have my school email connected to my phone, but I also have my work
        email as well. Why is it that on my days-off, I continue to check my
        work email? And why is it that on days I do not have school, I continue
        to check my school email? Do better, Kevin.

        The Design In Question
      </h2>

      <p>
        So, the amount of times I checked my email for the past week was quite a
        lot. The first thing I knew I had to do was figure out a format of how I
        would do the arrays. Knowing that I had both time and date, I set my
        time arrays under defined days. After I had the arrays down, I went
        straight to the design of it.

          I was inspired by the time assignment from a few weeks back. Seeing as
          I was keeping track of different times, I wanted to represent the data
          through a clock visualization. I used nested forLoop and arrays to
          create 10 clocks per day, for seven days. Each clock is a 24hr clock
          as opposed to 12hr; so where the 6hr time is on a standard clock is
          the 12hr time on my clock.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, I represented each hand of the clock with different colors to
          represent the different days as well. As an added bonus, I added a
          color animation based on a sin() and cos() map so the clock's colors
          are constantly changing based on the RGB codes.

        RÃ©flexion De Conception
      </h2>

      <p>
        As I begin to enter the halfway point of the semester, I find that the
        code I learned previously is easier to incorporate into the assignments.
        The arrays were confusing at first, I won't lie. It was difficult to
        think about nested arrays and nested forLoops as an abstraction versus a
        tangible thing I can draw. However, after some help from Sean (thanks by
        the way), I was able to figure out how to represent the arrays through
        the functions I defined and coded out. Visually speaking, this is one of
        the more simple codes I've sketched. However, the content behind it and
        the way it was laid out feels complex. I think that's okay. Hopefully.
