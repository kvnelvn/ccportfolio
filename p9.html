      <h2>
        A Consentful Interface
      </h2>
      <p>
        "Follow the F.R.I.E.S., and you will get a consentful interface." And so
        I did. That's the entire premise of this interface. Let's take a look.
      </p>

      <p>
        (F)reely given: I designed the interace to be without pressure, force,
        or manipulation. What it is is what it is. There's no hidden layer,
        double-crossing of the user, or gaslighting. I clearly state the
        intention of why the camera's used and that everything stays with the
        user. It gives power to whoever is using it.
      </p>

      <p>
        (R)eversible: it is always a priority that I have the option to opt out
        of using the camera. It's not enough to simply have it; the option needs
        to be easily accessible. I give a clear prompt that the user can opt out
        using a button, and I made that button easy to see and access. No
        digging through pages and pages of settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        (I)nformed: the interface informs the user what their camera is going to
        be used for. It also gives the user a privacy statement, letting them
        know that nothing is being recorded and saved. Straight to the point and
        simple. But effective.
      </p>

      <p>
        (E)nthusiastic: there's nothing in the interface that forces the user to
        give their camera access for the sake of using the Predator Cam. In
        fact, there's also no pressure for them to return if they opt out. The
        language is purposefully neutral versus overly excitable or
        manipulative. It's meant to let the user decide on their own.
      </p>

      <p>
        (S)pecific: specificity is another important aspect of this interface.
        Like I mentioned, I made it specific, clear, and straight-to-the-point
        when it came to the camera's purpose. There isn't any hidden meanings or
        layers behind it.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Well? Tell me! How'd You Do It?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Great question. I started with switch statements - they set the
        foundation of what the interface would look like, both on the front and
        back end. Once I knew how many scenes I needed to have, I began to work
        on the visuals. This was a fun assignment because I got to learn CSS
        code as well. With the DOMs and buttons, I customized these visual
        elements through style.css rather than through p5js. This gave me more
        freedom to assign different looks to different buttons without taking up
        too much space.
      </p>

      <p>
        The buttons were customized with CSS through style.css. There, I coded
        its characteristics, such as padding, background color, font, and even
        gave it hover and shadow interactions. I took some inspiration from
        Google's material design in order to incorporate a more "friendly" look
        and feel to it. Some UI fun, I guess?
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, I put everything together in the scenes. Everything came from
        user-defined functions, and was called in the draw function in the
        switch scenes. The overall interface has a clean and friendly aesthetic,
        just to give off a less intimidating vibe to go along with the concept
        of consentual design. I will say, I tried my damn hardest to write out
        code that turns off or hides the camera (especially that damn LED) when
        the camera's not being used, but could not figure it out. Well,
        something for the next iteration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's that code you asked for:

      <h2>
        Reflect! Reflect!
      </h2>

      <p>
        The F.R.I.E.S. model is very important to follow, especially when you're
        designing something that other people will be using. I've started to
        really think about what makes design consentful; but moreso than that,
        what makes it equitable. A million-page Terms and Conditions in 1px font
        that's incredibly difficult to find isn't consentful; sure you "give
        permission", but it's more than just that. This assignment really helped
        me to think through that lens. Cool shit.
