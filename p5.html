      <h2>
        An Optical Illusion
      </h2>

      <p>
        This optical illusion pattern is based off of a wallpaper that I
        originally wanted to purchase for my own apartment. I found this pattern
        to be a great example of an "optical illusion", as the way the squares
        are all laid out can create a sense of discomfort and confusion to look
        at. We were asked to pick a pattern that was also part of my culture. I
        chose not to find a pattern that pertained to my Asian heritage, as I
        spent the majority of my life growing up surrounded by "American"
        cultures. As a result, I chose something that felt very classicly
        "American" to me. The original sketches showed a mid-century pattern,
        and an art-deco pattern.

          I decided to go with the mid-century modern pattern, because it was
          the one that resonated with me the most. I've spent many years falling
          in love with mid-century designs, creating mood boards for mid-century
          interiors, and buying different mid-century furnitures to furnish my
          apartments. Needless to say, mid-century (are we tired of me saying
          this yet?) is very much an integral part of my design and artistic
          ethos.
        </p>

        <p>
          The way I went about coding this was pretty simple actually. I treated
          each "cube" as its own entity, so I created a user-defined function
          and drew the different rectangles in there. In addition, I wanted to
          animate a part of it, so I did a forLoop to create a group of circles
          that fit into one of the squares. I then took this user-defined
          function and did a forLoop, with different x-axis points, in order to
          fully take up the entire canvas.

        On This Week's: Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        This type of pattern is not uncommon. But, what I wanted to do was
        translate the aesthetic of a mid-century modern design into this type of
        optical illusion pattern. By imparting mid-century color palettes and
        aesthetics, I was able to transform a common optical illusion into
        something that felt more like an art piece. It retains the vintage and
        warm feel of a mid-century design, but still has contemporary lines and
        shapes. The addition of the animating circles is meant to combine
        contemporary animations with mid-century modern textures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recontextualizing this pattern in a digital format is very interesting.
        Mid-century patterns exist in a physical context i.e. wallpapers,
        textiles, rugs, etc. So to take the physical and recontextualize it into
        the digital feels like I'm creating another format in which this iconic
        design philosophy can exist. I even added a shaded animation in order
        to, metaphorically speaking, bring it to life. Kind of cool, right? I
        have mid-century in my home, and now I have mid-century in my portfolio.
