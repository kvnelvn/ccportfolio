        Description of Camille's Object
      </h2>

      <p>
        My dog's frisbee. A circular off-white sphere lost in what is most
        likely a field of grass. It has a raised lip that gives it grip. There
        are three smaller circles with a lighter stroke than the outline. They
        are centered evenly within each other and very close to one another so
        they barely overlap. The inner circle has enough room for an outline of
        a bone in the middle. The frisbee is a medium size (average frisbee
        size), and has an even texture.

        As a first time coder, I'm not going to lie: this was an extremely
        difficult process for me. I come from a design and art background, so to
        draw an image through code felt unnatural. However, I tried to treat
        this process how I would with Photoshop or Illustrator. I applied
        concepts from these applications to the assignment; organized by layers,
        group objects together and applied different setting to them, and so on.
        Instead of shapes and objects that I can create with my trackpack, I had
        to create them through another language. Designing with this mindset
        definitely helped me complete the assignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process I took was utilizing basic shapes to create Camille's lost
        object. Her description definitely helped in doing this, because she
        does mention "sphere" and "circle." Going forward, I used primarily
        circles and triangles to draw up the frisbee, and the grass that it was
        probably lost in. Even the dog bone was coded together using four
        circles, a rectangle, and two lines. Though, I will admit, it was
        difficult to do an outline versus a "fill" for the bone.

        Overall, Camille used very basic language to describe her object. She
        utilized familiar shapes, like sphere and circle, to describe the
        contents of the frisbee. Not only did she provide decriptions of shapes,
        but she also gave spacial descriptions, so I knew where to put the
        overlapping circles and bone. As a result, I interpreted the image quite
        literally, because it was a very literal description. There was not a
        lot of room for creative freedom, which I did not mind! The one aspect
        of the description I had difficulty grasping was "raised lip." That
        description threw me off, because it was difficult to code that without
        it ending up unlike the shape and image of a frisbee. As a result, I
        ended up creating a shadow on the frisbee to give it the illusion that
        it was not a flat circle, and had an area that was able to be gripped.
      </p>

      <p>
        The coded image turned out almost what I initially sketched out. I knew
        I wanted to depict it at an angle, so it wasn't just a flat 2D circle.
        The addition of the shadows, and the "shear" of the shapes helped bring
        the 3D aspect of it alive. Interpreting it through sketching and code
        could not have been more different. When you have a pencil and paper,
        you can easily and quickly draw the image of a frisbee, shade it to give
        it the 3D effect. In code, this is not a simple process (for me at
        least). I had to think about the coordinates of where the shapes would
        land, and connect pixels in order to get rid of gaps between shapes.
        Don't even get me started on "rotate." Overall, I think this is a
        successful interpretation of Camille's lost object.
