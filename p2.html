        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        The design process for this one was very different than the first
        assignment; it was more experimental. I first drew my face on Procreate.
        My face is based off of Slipknot's Corey Taylor's mask from their "All
        Hope Is Gone" album.
      </p>

          I knew from the moment I drew the sketch, that I wanted to give the
          final assignment a look and feel of horror and uneasiness. I took
          simple shapes (rounded rectangles and circles) and simplified the
          initial sketch. Originally, I tried to create bezier curves to have a
          more "face-like" shape, but I couldn't make that work.

      <p>
        Once I had the basic elements of the mask coded, I wanted to add
        mousePressed elements to generator different sized faces. From there,
        that's where things got experimental. I referenced the "blinking" code
        from user "doubleshow." This created a strobe effect for the eyes,
        mouth, and nose, similar to the strobing lights the band uses during
        their live shows. I took this a step further to create a (mouseX,mouseY)
        movement to showcase a "3D" like effect. It's like the face is
        SCREAMING. Finally, I used mouseIfPressed so it generates randomly-sized
        faces. It also changes the color by using random(255). Overall, the code
        translated well into the overall idea I initially sketched up. It even
        managed to have a very "glitchy" and horror vibe to it.

      <h2>
        What the hell did I discover?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Face Generator was one hell of an assignment. I will not lie, I did
        actually enjoy this one. Maybe it's because I experimented and looked
        for different ways to code new things. It also taught me a few new
        coding skills, of which I hope to retain and grow from. This assignment
        got me to understand the constraints that we can incorporate into our
        code. Using "if/else" and variables and parameters, I got to code a way
        to interact with a bunch of randomly generated faces. Perhaps I spent
        too much time experimenting, because the final outcome did not really
        reflect my initial min/max sketch of the mask. But it's definitely an
        interesting journey to go from the sketch to code. In the end, I was
        still able to generate a variety of different shapes. Perhaps I need to
        constrain myself next time (get it?) and focus more on nailing my
        concepts. Or do I just say, fuck it, and design from my heart?
