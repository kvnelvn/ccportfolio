      <h1>
        The "Infrared" Camera
      </h1>

      <p>
        No, it's not really infrared. But I knew I wanted to, visually, mimic
        the way infrared cameras capture their subjects. Cameras can capture
        many different subjects through many different forms. For me, I was
        inspired by infrared/thermal lenses, specifically from the film
        "Predator." I was watching how the Predator uses the infrared/thermal
        vision to hunt its prey using their heat signatures to identify them.
        What if infrared cameras were used in a surveillance context, or
        interrogation context, or some other CSI context? An infrared camera can
        spot heat signatures, and therefore identify things that a regular
        camera wouldn't have seen otherwise. Is there an inherently "good" or
        "bad" use of this type of camera? To me, that's the meaning I'm trying
        to impart through this assignment and experimental camera. Even though
        it's not actually a themral camera, it's still interesting to see it in
        this context.

        How it's made:
      </h1>

      <p>
        First of all, big shoutout to Sean for helping me through this
        assignment. I was quite lost, but Sean's fantastic guidance helped me
        get to where I am with this experimental camera. King.

        Once I understood the context of "capture" and arrays, using the pixels,
        I knew I had to separate out the RGB pixels in order to then assign a
        shape and fill to each one. Using if/else statements, I did just that. I
        separated the values (0, 255) and assigned a specific if statement to
        them. For example, if any of the RGB pixels were less than 50 in value,
        then it would generate a specific fill color and shape. I did this on
        three separate if/else statements to generate an infrared look.

          Instead of running my for loops under x & y++, I did a step count of
          10 so that I could render the camera capture easier. Additionally, it
          made it possibile to code different shapes for the if/else statements.
          I did square, circle, and triangles for each of the if/else statements
          so that there was a variety within the canvas. I also wanted to give
          the camera a feeling that it's "alive" so I made some of the colors
          and shape sizes random(), so that it would fluctutate and almost feel
          like it's "breathing" - something to mimic and reflect the nature of
          heat signatures and body movements.

          Look here, it's the code:

        <h1>
          As I reflect...
        </h1>

        <p>
          I think about the access that our cameras have to, well everything.
          The very computer I did this assignment on was on and running the
          entire time; my iPhone's camera is used to unlock the phone; where I
          work has security cameras posted up on walls and ceilings. It's
          interesting to think about the reliance, but also the rejection, of
          camera technology that's increasingly embedded in our lives. I'm
          neither 100% for or against this. Sometimes I love cameras - I love
          being able to capture selfies with my friends, or to try out fun
          unique filters done by creative coders. But I also dislike that
          there's always the possibility that someone could access my camera and
          watch me, without my knowledge of it. So who knows? I certainly don't.
